Appearently "Identity on ASP.NET Core" and "IdentityServer4" are two separete topics with basically the same name - one is a "common solution for user management" and the other is "setting up an auth server". Implement both topics and investigate the relation between them. Separate the two topics into different repositories if they have nothing to do with each other.
